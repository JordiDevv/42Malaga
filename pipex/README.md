# 🔗 Pipex

## 🔍 Overview
The **Pipex** project aims to help students understand and master fundamental C programming concepts, such as inter-process communication, the use of pipes, and standard input/output redirections. This project provides insight into how pipes and redirections work in Unix-based systems.

This was the first project I developed entirely from scratch without any external assistance, proving my exponential progress and learning when tackling projects and writing code.

## ✨ Features
- 🔄 Inter-process communication using pipes
- 📡 Redirection of standard input and output
- 🖥️ Understanding Unix system calls
- 🛠️ Process handling and execution
