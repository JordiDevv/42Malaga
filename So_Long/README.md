## 🔍 Overview
The **2D Graphics Game** project introduces students to graphical programming using a graphics library. We developed a small game where the main character can move within a 2D environment, interact with the game world, and engage with various elements. This project helps in understanding advanced concepts such as 2D graphics rendering, matrix manipulation, linear transformations, and event handling.

Additionally, I implemented a small AI system that allows enemies to move randomly. Given that the game uses a top-down view with a tile grid, this added an interesting dynamic to the gameplay.

One of the key challenges was developing all parsing functions from scratch, including implementing a function similar to `realloc` for efficient memory management.

## ✨ Features
- 🕹️ 2D character movement and interaction
- 🎨 Graphical rendering using a graphics library
- 🔄 Matrix manipulation and transformations
- 🧠 AI-driven enemy movement with randomness
- 🗂️ Custom file parsing and memory management
