# 🔄 Push_swap

## 🔍 Overview
The **Push_swap** project focuses on developing efficient sorting algorithms to sort a stack of integers in ascending order using a limited set of instructions. Students must implement two programs: one that sorts the stack of numbers and another that verifies whether a given set of instructions correctly sorts the stack.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Efficient sorting of integer stacks
- 🔢 Implementation of a limited set of operations (`sa`, `sb`, `ss`, `pa`, `pb`, `ra`, `rb`, `rr`, `rra`, `rrb`, `rrr`)
- 🛠️ Algorithm optimization for minimal moves
- 📊 Checker program to validate sorting correctness
- ⚡ Handles edge cases and large input sizes
