# 🔠 Dash 02 - 42 Malaga 💻  

This repository contains the solution for the second dash at **42 Málaga**.  

## ❓ What it consists of?  

This is a ⚡ challenge that consists of **four exercises**, progressively increasing in difficulty. The final task is to count the occurrences of each letter in a given sentence using **C**, following the school's coding standards.  

## 🛠️ How does it work?  

### **Exercise Breakdown**  

1. **ft_star** – Print seven asterisks and a line break.
2. **occ_a** – Write a function that counts the instances of 'A' in a string given and returns it.
3. **count_alen** – Write a function that counts the lenght of a given string 'til the first 'a' instance.
4. **count_alpha** – Count the occurrences of each letter in a given string. 

### **Final Challenge: Letter Counting**  

- **Input Handling:** The program takes a string as input and processes each character.  
- **Character Counting:** It tracks the number of times each letter (a-z, A-Z) appears.  
- **Output Format:** The result is displayed in a structured format, maintaining **norme** compliance.  

## 📏 Norme  

To ensure structured coding and best practices, the following rules must be followed:  

- **Allowed external functions:** Only `write`, `malloc`, and `free` are permitted.  
- **Number of scripts:** A maximum of **two** scripts.  
- **Functions per script:** A maximum of **five** functions per script.  
- **Lines per function:** Each function can have up to **25** lines.  
- **Variable declaration:** Declaring and assigning a value in the same line is not allowed.  

These constraints ensure clean, efficient, and well-structured code while fostering creativity. 🚀
